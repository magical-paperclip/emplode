# mood playground

a tiny browser toy: pick a colour circle that matches your vibe, fill in what’s bugging you, then mess with a couple of quick coping tools.

* **crumple note** – drag the sticky around, double-click to crunch it out of sight.
* **deep breath** – inhale / exhale loop that chills in the middle until you reset.

runs locally in the browser – the node socket backend is still there but optional.

## run

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
then hit **http://localhost:3000**.

## tweak stuff

no build step. just poke files in `public/` and refresh.
